*    All files end with a new line
*    First line of all files is exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
*    A README.md file at the root of the holbertonschool-higher_level_programming repo, containing a description of the repository is present
*    A README.md file, at the root of the folder of this project, is present
*    Code uses PEP 8 style (version 1.7.*)
*    All files are executable
*    Length of files tested using wc

## **Shell Scripts**

*    Wditor used: emacs
*    All scripts tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
*    All scripts are exactly two lines long (wc -l file should print 2)
*    All files end with a new line
*    The first line of all files is exactly #!/bin/bash
*    All files are executable
## **C Scripts**

*    Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
*    All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
*    Your programs and functions will be compiled with gcc 4.8.4 using the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic
*    All your files should end with a new line
*    Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
*    You are not allowed to use global variables
*    No more than 5 functions per file
*    In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
*    The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called lists.h
*    Don’t forget to push your header file
*    All your header files should be include guarded
